    <p>  jThis is as close as I have found to the apple pancake at the Original Pancake House. A fluffy, sweet pancake. Excellent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. </p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 large apple, cored and sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apple slices, about 1/4 cup sugar, and cinnamon in butter until apples are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs, milk, flour, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl until batter is smooth; pour batter evenly over apples.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Run a spatula around the edges of the pancake to loosen. Invert skillet over a large plate to serve.</li>
    </ol>
