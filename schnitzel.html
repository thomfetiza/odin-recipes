    <p> In its most basic form, schnitzel is a slice of meat, often pounded until fairly thin, then breaded and fried. The dish's name actually comes from the German word "schnitt," which translates to "cut." The most popular type of meat for schnitzel is veal (wiener-schnitzel) or pork (schweine-schnitzel), but you also see varieties made with chicken (h√§nchen-schnitzel), or turkey (puten-schnitzel). The breading is typically an easy coating of flour, egg wash, and breadcrumbs. Schnitzel is typically not highly seasoned, relying instead on bold toppings like fresh lemon wedges, mushroom sauce, or cream sauce to add a boost of flavor. </p>

    <p>Translation of the name: 'Wiener' this word comes from the word 'Wien', which is the Austrian city called Vienna. 'Schnitzel' means basically meat in a crust. I'm German and hope you can understand my English description. Serve the schnitzels with salad, ketchup and French fries. </p>
